# JavaScript-Calculator
A calculator program in JavaScript. This simple JavaScript calculator will prompt the user, and accept the operator the user intends to use as an input, then further accepts two values, and evaluates them, using the operator type the user chooses. The operator choice could be a +, -, * or /. I wrote this program making use of the "switch" statement. The same result could be achieved with the "if else" statement. This is pure JavaScript without any HTML or CSS.
